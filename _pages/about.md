Currently, I'm a research intern at [LG AI Research](https://www.lgresearch.ai/kor/) working with large language models in the `Language` Team.

I'm double majoring in Statistics and Computer Science and Engineering at [Korea University](https://stat.korea.edu/stat_en/index.do). I worked as an undergraduate researcher at [DAVIAN](http://davian.kaist.ac.kr/research/visualization.html) (Data and Visual Analytics Laboratory) where I was advised by Jaegul Choo. Currently, I'm working as an undergraduate researcher at [LK Lab](https://lklab.kaist.ac.kr/) (Language & Knowledge Laboratory), advised by Minjoon Seo. I am planning to continue my study in natural language processing after graduation.

My primary research interest mainly focuses on building inclusive language models that can jointly reason over `multilingual` text and improving the modelâ€™s `generalizability` and `extrapolation` to various tasks and domains. I would like to develop novel methods that can effectively generalize and adapt to diverse settings to overcome the previous domain specified methods.

I come from `Seoul`, South Korea and grew up in `Beijing`, China for 8 years and in `Prague`, Czech Republic for 4 years. Outside research, I enjoy baking (I own my own [bakery](https://smartstore.naver.com/kkma_bakery)), swimming, extreme activities, solo traveling, and learning different languages. Currently, I am bilingual in Korean and English, conversational in French and Chinese.
